Tagalong helps people get fitter and healthier by lowering the barrier to creating a fitness habit through creating casual, commitment-free environments to exercise with real friends. Tagalong draws on the affordances unique to the mobile device, such as location information and the ability to intervene at the moment of decision helping overcome behavioral impediments to going to exercise.
